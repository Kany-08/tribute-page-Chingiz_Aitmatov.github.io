          <h3><em>Jamila</em></h3>
          <p>
            “The most beautiful love story in the world.”—Louis Aragon The
            Second World War is raging, and Jamilia’s husband is off fighting at
            the front. Accompanied by Daniyar, a sullen newcomer who was wounded
            on the battlefield, Jamilia spends her days hauling sacks of grain
            from the threshing floor to the train station in their village in
            the Central Asia. Spurning men’s advances and wincing at the
            dispassionate letters she receives from her husband, Jamilia falls
            helplessly in love with the mysterious Daniyar in this
            heartbreakingly beautiful tale. A classic from the award-winning
            Kyrgyz novelist Chingiz Aitmatov. A champion of freedom, Chingiz
            Aitmatov is one of the most famous writers from Eurasia and,
            according to UNESCO, one of the most widely published authors of the
            20th century. His books, which introduced the mountains and lakes of
            his native Kyrgyzstan to readers in 176 language, emphasize
            individual liberty, respect for the natural world and reverence for
            the traditions of minority peoples.

          <h3><em>The Day Lasts More Than a Hundred Years</em></h3>
          <p>
            In an introduction written in 1990, during perestroika, the author
            wrote that the original title was The Hoop ("Обруч"), which was
            rejected by censors. The title The Day Lasts More Than a Hundred
            Years, taken from the poem "Unique Days" ("единственные дни") by
            Boris Pasternak, used for the magazine version (Novy Mir, #11,
            1980), was also criticized as too complicated, and the first
            "book-size" version of the novel was printed in Roman-Gazeta in a
            censored form under the title The Buranny Railway Stop (Буранный
            полустанок).

          <h3><em>The White Ship</em></h3>
          <p>
            "The White Ship" is a story of a young boy who grows up with his
            grandfather, Momun, on the shores of Issyk-Kul Lake. He spends time
            exploring, listening to legends from his grandfather, and looking
            out over the lake as white ships sail along. He finds particular
            interest in the stories that his grandfather tells him about the
            Horned Mother Deer that is sacred to the Bogo tribe. A series of
            tragedies occurs at the end of the novella, and a hunting party
            kills a sacred deer with Momun and the boy as witnesses. This sends
            the boy into despair. Longing for love and acceptance, he dives into
            the waters of a stream nearby to "turn into a fish" and swim towards
            Issyk-Kul in search of his father. A controversy surrounded the
            novel after publication due to its graphic and violent depictions of
            Soviet "heroes" as well as hints of child suicide.

          <h3><em>The First Teacher</em></h3>
          <p>
            The action takes place in the years from 1924 all the way to the
            early 1950s in the Kurkureu village of the Kyrgyz Soviet Socialist
            Republic, which is now Kyrgyzstan. The Russian Civil War ended not
            so long ago. Young Komsomol member and a former Red Army soldier,
            Dyuyshen, travels to a remote village where he takes up his post as
            the new teacher for the children of the village. His enthusiasm to
            bring new ideas immediately faces a centuries-old tradition of life
            in Central Asia. The former soldier tries to improve the children's
            literacy but faces opposition from the Moslem parents who, moreover,
            look unfavourably on the idea of a girl joining the school. Dyuyshen
            meets Altynai, a 15-year-old illiterate girl who has a burning
            desire to study, but her aunt sells her to a powerful and wealthy
            chieftain. The school is burned down. The film ends with the promise
            of it being rebuilt using a centuries-old tree which had been a
            source of pride to the villagers.
